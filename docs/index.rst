Welcome to Aeronet's documentation!
===================================

**Aim and scope**

Aeronetlib is designed to make it easier for the deep learning researchers to handle the remote sensing data.

The main functionality of the library:

- handling of the geospatial rasters, including big images;
- random sampling of the image patches from a dataset for the model training;
- sequential sampling of the patches from an image for inference;
- transformation between raster mask and vector polygons in both directions.
